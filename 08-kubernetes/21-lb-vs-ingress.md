## Difference Between Ingress and LoadBalancer Service Type in Kubernetes

### Question  
What is the difference between using an **Ingress** and a **LoadBalancer service** in Kubernetes?

### Short explanation of the question  
This question evaluates your understanding of exposing Kubernetes services externally and how you manage routing and traffic to applications running inside the cluster.

---

### Answer  
A **LoadBalancer** service exposes a single service using a cloud provider’s external load balancer, while **Ingress** acts as a reverse proxy and routes HTTP(S) traffic to multiple services based on rules like hostnames and paths — all using a **single external IP**.

### ⚙️ LoadBalancer Service

- **Creates a cloud provider-managed external load balancer** (like AWS ELB or Azure LB).
- Allocates **one public IP per service**.
- Best for **simple apps** or **non-HTTP protocols** (e.g., TCP, UDP).
- Straightforward setup.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

🧠 Use when you want **external access to a single service** without complex routing.

### 🌐 Ingress Resource

- **Acts as an HTTP reverse proxy**.
- Routes requests to different services **based on hostname or path**.
- Uses a **single LoadBalancer IP**, which makes it cost-effective.
- Requires an **Ingress Controller** (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB Controller).

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: app.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

🧠 Use when you want **advanced routing** and to avoid creating multiple public IPs.

### 🧪 Real-World Use Case

> “In our microservices app, we had 12 backend services. Instead of creating 12 LoadBalancers, we used Ingress with host-based rules (e.g., api.example.com, auth.example.com) and handled TLS termination at the Ingress controller.”

### 🔄 Summary Table

| Feature                   | LoadBalancer Service        | Ingress                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| External IP per service   | ✅ Yes (per service)         | ❌ No (shared)                   |
| HTTP routing rules        | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes (path/host based)         |
| TLS termination support   | ❌ Manual                    | ✅ Built-in                      |
| Cost efficient            | ❌ More IPs = more cost      | ✅ Single entry point            |
| Handles non-HTTP traffic  | ✅ Yes (TCP/UDP)             | ❌ HTTP/HTTPS only               |
| Requires Ingress Controller | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes                           |

### Key takeaway  

> Use **LoadBalancer** for exposing a single service directly, and **Ingress** when you want smart routing, TLS, and cost efficiency with multiple services behind one entry point.
