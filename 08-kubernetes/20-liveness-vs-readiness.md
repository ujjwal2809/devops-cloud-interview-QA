## Difference Between Liveness and Readiness Probes in Kubernetes

### Question  
What is the difference between **liveness** and **readiness** probes in Kubernetes?

### Short explanation of the question  
This checks your understanding of Kubernetes’ health check mechanisms that help manage container lifecycle and service availability.

---

### Answer  
**Liveness probes** check if a container is alive and should be restarted if unresponsive.  
**Readiness probes** check if a container is ready to receive traffic. If not, it's removed from the service endpoints until it's ready.

### 💡 What is a Probe?

Probes are periodic checks Kubernetes performs to determine the state of a container.  
There are three types: `liveness`, `readiness`, and `startup`.

---

### 🔁 Liveness Probe

- **Purpose:** Detect if a container is stuck or dead.
- **Behavior:** If the liveness probe fails, the container is **restarted**.
- **Common use case:** Detects application lock-ups (e.g., infinite loops, deadlocks).

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
```

🧠 Think of this as: “Should this container be killed and restarted?”

---

### 🟢 Readiness Probe

- **Purpose:** Check if the app is **ready to accept traffic**.
- **Behavior:** If the readiness probe fails, the pod is **removed from the service endpoint list**, but **not restarted**.
- **Common use case:** Wait for app to fully initialize before receiving requests.

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 3
```

🧠 Think of this as: “Is this container ready to serve traffic?”

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example

> “We had a Java app that took ~40 seconds to load its cache. The readiness probe prevented traffic from hitting it too early, while the liveness probe restarted it if the app crashed during runtime.”

### 🔄 Summary Table

| Feature            | Liveness Probe             | Readiness Probe              |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Checks if app is   | **Alive**                  | **Ready to serve traffic**   |
| Failure Action     | Restarts the container     | Removes from service routing |
| Restarted on fail? | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                         |
| Affects traffic?   | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                        |

---

### Key takeaway  

> Use **readiness** probes to ensure your app isn’t hit with traffic too early, and **liveness** probes to auto-recover from hangs or crashes.
