## Design a Solution to Avoid Rollbacks in Production

### Question  
How would you design a deployment strategy or workflow to **minimize or eliminate the need for rollbacks** after a faulty release?

### Short explanation of the question  
This question focuses on **proactive quality assurance and risk mitigation** — preventing bad releases from reaching production, rather than reacting with a rollback.

---

### Answer  
To avoid rollbacks, we focus on a **“shift-left” strategy** with robust **pre-deployment validation**, **progressive delivery**, and **automated quality gates** using GitOps and observability tools. This ensures that only validated, low-risk changes reach production.

### Detailed explanation of the answer for readers’ understanding

### ✅ 1. Pre-Deployment Safety Nets

| Technique                     | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automated Testing**        | Run unit, integration, and regression tests in CI before merge/deploy       |
| **Schema and Config Validation** | Use tools like `kubeval`, `kubeconform`, `opa`, or `tflint` to validate infra code |
| **Security Scanning**        | Run tools like `Trivy`, `Snyk`, or `Checkov` in the pipeline                |
| **Static Code Analysis**     | Linting, code smells, and code coverage enforced via CI tools like SonarQube |

---

### 🚦 2. Use Progressive Delivery

Implement strategies like:

- **Canary deployments** using Argo Rollouts or Flagger
- **Feature flags** to toggle new features without deploying new code
- **Blue-Green deployments** for large releases where rollback speed is critical

These allow testing changes in **real environments** with **real traffic**, minimizing full-scale impact.

### 🔍 3. Observability + Quality Gates

Set up **real-time metrics monitoring and alerts** for:

| Type           | Examples                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Latency        | Increase in request duration              |
| Error rate     | 4xx/5xx spike                             |
| Resource usage | Pod CPU/memory usage                      |
| Logs           | Error/warning patterns                    |

Use these metrics in **Argo Rollouts** or **CI pipelines** to auto-pause or fail releases before full rollout.

### 🧠 4. Use GitOps for Controlled Deployments

- All deployments happen through Git (e.g. via Argo CD).
- Teams cannot apply YAML manually — reducing human error.
- Any change is traceable, auditable, and reversible.

---

### 🧪 5. Real-World Deployment Guardrails

> “In our CI/CD pipeline, every pull request runs 500+ unit tests, Helm template validations, and schema checks. Once merged, Argo Rollouts begins a canary release to 10% traffic, monitored via Prometheus. We only proceed to 100% if no error spikes are detected within 10 minutes.”

### 🧰 Tech Stack Involved

| Area              | Tools                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| CI/CD             | GitHub Actions, Argo CD, Argo Rollouts      |
| Code Quality      | SonarQube, ESLint, PyLint, etc.             |
| Infra Linting     | kubeval, tflint, checkov                    |
| Observability     | Prometheus, Loki, Grafana                   |
| Security          | Trivy, Snyk, Aqua                           |

### Key takeaway  

> “Avoiding rollbacks means investing in **quality control, progressive rollout, and observability** before production. Treat deployment as a gradual, monitored process — not a one-shot push.”
