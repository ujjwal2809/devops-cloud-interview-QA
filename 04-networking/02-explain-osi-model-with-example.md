## Question  
Explain the complete flow of a request from client to server using the OSI Model.

### 📝 Short Explanation  
This question checks if you understand how a network request travels across layers — from user input in a browser to reaching a remote server — using the 7 layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model.

## ✅ Answer  

The **OSI Model** has **7 layers**, and each layer plays a specific role in transferring data from a client (like a browser) to a server (like a web server).  

Here’s how it works when you type a URL like `https://example.com` and hit Enter:

---

### 📘 Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**  
- You type `https://example.com` in a browser.
- The browser creates an HTTP request.
- This request goes through the application layer using protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP.

🧠 **Key Protocols**: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SMTP

---

#### 2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**  
- Ensures the data is in the right format.
- Handles encryption (SSL/TLS) and compression.

🧠 Example: HTTPS encryption starts here.

---

#### 3. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**  
- Manages session establishment and teardown between client and server.
- Keeps track of connections so that sessions can resume or timeout gracefully.

🧠 Think of it as opening and maintaining a conversation between two devices.

---

#### 4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**  
- Breaks data into **segments** and ensures **reliable delivery**.
- Adds source and destination **port numbers**.

🧠 **Key Protocols**: TCP (reliable), UDP (faster but no guarantee)

🧠 Example: HTTP usually uses TCP port 80, HTTPS uses TCP port 443.

---

#### 5. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**  
- Adds source and destination **IP addresses**.
- Chooses the **best route** for the packet across the internet.

🧠 **Key Protocol**: IP (Internet Protocol)

---

#### 6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**  
- Converts data into **frames**.
- Adds MAC addresses of the devices on a local network.
- Handles **error detection** and **physical addressing**.

🧠 Example: Ethernet/Wi-Fi protocol operates here.

---

#### 7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**  
- Transfers raw **bits** (0s and 1s) over physical hardware like cables, Wi-Fi signals, or fiber optics.

🧠 Example: Electrical signals, radio waves, fiber optics

---

### 🔄 Then What Happens?

- At the server side, the data flows **upward from Layer 1 to Layer 7**.
- Each layer **removes the headers** added by the client side and processes the payload.
- Finally, the server **responds**, and the response travels **back through the same layers** in reverse.

### 🧠 Analogy

> Sending a letter:
> - You write a message (App layer).
> - Put it in an envelope (Presentation).
> - Mark sender/recipient (Session).
> - Choose a postal service (Transport).
> - Address it (Network).
> - The postman routes it (Data Link).
> - Finally, it goes through trucks/planes (Physical).

---

> Summary:  
> The OSI model helps us understand how data flows across a network. It breaks the process into layers so we can troubleshoot and build systems more effectively. Each layer wraps or unwraps data, guiding it from your browser to a server — and back.
