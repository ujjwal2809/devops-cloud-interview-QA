## Question  
What is the difference between Public and Private Subnets?

### 📝 Short Explanation  
The key difference lies in **internet accessibility**:  
- **Public subnets** can directly communicate with the internet.  
- **Private subnets** cannot, unless they go through a **NAT Gateway** or similar service.

## ✅ Answer  

| Type             | Internet Access      | Use Case                                 | Route Table Configuration                   |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Public Subnet**  | Yes (via Internet Gateway) | Load balancers, Bastion hosts, public APIs | Route to Internet Gateway (IGW)              |
| **Private Subnet** | No direct internet access  | Databases, app servers, internal services  | No direct route to IGW; NAT Gateway optional |

### 📘 Detailed Explanation

#### 🌐 Public Subnet
- A **public subnet** is a subnet that has a route to an **Internet Gateway (IGW)**.
- EC2 instances in this subnet can be accessed from the internet **if they have public IPs**.
- Common use cases:
  - Web servers
  - Bastion hosts
  - NAT Gateways

📌 Route Table Example:
```text
Destination      Target
0.0.0.0/0        igw-xxxxxxxx
```

#### 🔒 Private Subnet
- A **private subnet** has **no direct route** to the internet.
- Instances **cannot be accessed** directly from the internet even if they have a public IP (which they shouldn’t).
- If outbound access is needed (e.g., to install packages), they route traffic via a **NAT Gateway** placed in a **public subnet**.

📌 Route Table Example (with NAT):
```text
Destination      Target
0.0.0.0/0        nat-xxxxxxxx
```

### 🧠 Analogy

- **Public Subnet**: Like a house with a door that opens directly to the street (internet).
- **Private Subnet**: Like a room in a gated community — you can go out, but only through controlled paths (NAT).

> Summary:  
> - **Public subnet** → has internet access via IGW.  
> - **Private subnet** → no direct internet access. Used for backend services, databases, and sensitive components.
