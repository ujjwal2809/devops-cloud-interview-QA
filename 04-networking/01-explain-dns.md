# What is DNS ?

## Question  
What is DNS? Explain in simple words.

### 📝 Short Explanation  
DNS is like the internet’s **phonebook**. It helps translate website names into IP addresses that computers use to talk to each other.

## ✅ Answer  

DNS stands for **Domain Name System**.  

When you type a website like `www.google.com` into your browser, your computer doesn't understand that name directly. Instead, it asks the DNS system to find the IP address (like `142.250.64.100`) that matches `www.google.com`.  

Once it gets the IP address, your computer can connect to the right server and load the website.

### 📘 Detailed Explanation

- **Domain name**: A human-friendly name like `amazon.com`.
- **IP address**: A computer-friendly address like `192.0.2.1`.
- **DNS Resolver**: The system that looks up domain names and returns IP addresses.

#### 🔄 Step-by-Step Process:
1. You enter `www.example.com` in your browser.
2. Your computer asks the **DNS resolver** for the IP address.
3. The resolver checks its cache or queries other DNS servers.
4. Once it finds the matching IP, it returns it to your browser.
5. Your browser connects to the IP and loads the website.

### 🧠 Example:
Think of **DNS** like asking someone for a restaurant’s phone number:
- You say: “I want to call Domino’s Pizza.”
- DNS replies: “Here’s the number: 123-456-7890.”
- Now you can call and place your order.

> Summary:  
> DNS is a behind-the-scenes system that lets us use easy names like `google.com` instead of hard-to-remember IP addresses. Without DNS, we’d need to remember IP numbers for every website!
