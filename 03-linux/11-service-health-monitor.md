## Question  
You are asked to monitor multiple services like `nginx`, `sshd`, and `docker`.  

**Task:**  
- Write a shell script that checks the status of each service.
- If a service is stopped, attempt to restart it.
- Print a clearly formatted report.

### 📝 Short Explanation  
This tests your ability to write robust service monitoring automation for multiple services, which is a common expectation in DevOps and SRE roles.

## ✅ Answer  

### 🖥️ Shell Script: `multi_service_monitor.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# List of services to monitor
services=("nginx" "sshd" "docker")

# Report Header
echo "-----------------------------------"
echo "  Service Health Check Report"
echo "-----------------------------------"

# Loop through services
for service in "${services[@]}"; do
  if systemctl is-active --quiet "$service"; then
    echo "$service is ✅ RUNNING"
  else
    echo "$service is ❌ STOPPED"
    echo ""
    echo "Attempting to restart $service..."

    systemctl restart "$service" &> /dev/null

    # Check if restart was successful
    if systemctl is-active --quiet "$service"; then
      echo "$service has been ✅ restarted successfully."
    else
      echo "❌ Failed to restart $service. Manual intervention needed."
    fi
  fi
  echo "-----------------------------------"
done
```

### ✅ Example Output (if `docker` is down):

```
-----------------------------------
  Service Health Check Report
-----------------------------------
nginx is ✅ RUNNING
-----------------------------------
sshd is ✅ RUNNING
-----------------------------------
docker is ❌ STOPPED

Attempting to restart docker...
docker has been ✅ restarted successfully.
-----------------------------------
```

### 📘 Detailed Explanation

- **`services=(...)`**: An array of services to monitor.
- **`systemctl is-active`**: Checks if a service is running.
- **`systemctl restart`**: Tries to restart the service if it's not active.
- **Conditional Restart Check**: After restarting, the script confirms whether the service started successfully.
- **Output Formatting**: Clean section dividers and emojis provide clarity in console or logs.

### ⏰ Optional Cron Usage
To run every 10 minutes:

```bash
*/10 * * * * /path/to/multi_service_monitor.sh >> /var/log/service_check.log 2>&1
```

> Summary:  
> This script checks and restarts critical services like `nginx`, `sshd`, and `docker`, and reports the status clearly. It's a lightweight way to keep essential services alive without external monitoring tools.
