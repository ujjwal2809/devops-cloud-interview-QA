### 📝 Short Explanation

```

### 📘 Detailed Explanation

#### 🔍 Breakdown:
- `sed`: Stream editor used to process text line-by-line.
- `'1d'`: Deletes the **first line** (`1` = line number).
- `'$d'`: Deletes the **last line** (`$` = end of file).
- `filename.txt`: The file to be processed.

Together, the command says:
> "Delete the first line **and** the last line from `filename.txt`."

### ✅ Example:

If `file.txt` contains:
```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
```

Command:
```bash
sed '1d; $d' file.txt
```

Output:
```
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
```

### 🧠 Bonus Tip:
If you want to **save the result to a new file**:
```bash
sed '1d; $d' file.txt > trimmed.txt
```

> Summary:  
> The `sed '1d; $d'` command is an efficient way to remove both the first and last lines of a text file using line number and end-of-file markers.
