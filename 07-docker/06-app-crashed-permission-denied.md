## App Crashes with "Permission Denied" in Container but works fine on localhost

### Question  
Your application runs fine locally, but when containerized and run with Docker, it crashes with a "Permission Denied" error. What could be the issue and how would you fix it?

### Short explanation of the question  
This scenario is testing your knowledge of how file permissions, user IDs, and execution rights differ inside a Docker container versus the host system.

### Answer  
The likely cause is that the app or script lacks proper execution permissions in the container or is being run as a non-root user without access. I’d check file permissions and adjust the Dockerfile to ensure the user has necessary rights.

### Detailed explanation of the answer for readers’ understanding

This issue often stems from:

---

### 🔒 1. **Permissions not preserved during COPY**

When using `COPY` in Dockerfile, default permissions might not be sufficient.

For example, a shell script might be copied into the container without execute permission:

```Dockerfile
COPY start.sh /app/start.sh
```

If you run it like this:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["/app/start.sh"]
```

It will throw:

```
Permission denied
```

#### ✅ Fix

Set executable permission inside Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
RUN chmod +x /app/start.sh
```

---

### 👤 2. **Running as non-root user inside the container**

If your Dockerfile switches to a non-root user for security:

```Dockerfile
USER appuser
```

That user may not have access to directories/files unless proper ownership and permissions are set.

#### ✅ Fix

Ensure files are owned or accessible by that user:

```Dockerfile
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app
```

---

### 🧪 3. **Volume mounts with restricted permissions**

Sometimes the container mounts a host directory or file that’s owned by root on host, but not accessible to container's user.

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data myapp
```

If `/data` contains a file not readable by container user, you’ll get "Permission Denied."

#### ✅ Fix

Adjust host file permissions:

```bash
chmod -R 755 data/
```

Or avoid mounting sensitive paths.

### 🔍 Debugging steps

- Use `ls -l` inside container to inspect permissions:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it <container> ls -l /app
  ```

- Run container with interactive shell:
  ```bash
  docker run -it myapp /bin/sh
  ```

### 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “In one CI build, a Python script crashed with `Permission Denied`. Turned out we copied it from host, but forgot `chmod +x` in the Dockerfile. Fixed it by updating the Dockerfile with `RUN chmod +x script.py`.”

---

### Key takeaway

> "Always check file permissions and user context in your Dockerfile. A script may run fine on your machine but fail inside a container due to missing execute permissions or user access."
