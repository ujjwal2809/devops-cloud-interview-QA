## What is the purpose of EXPOSE in Dockerfile?

### Question  
What is the purpose of the `EXPOSE` instruction in a Dockerfile?

### Short explanation of the question  
This question is meant to test your understanding of how container networking works and how ports are communicated within and outside the container runtime.

### Answer  
`EXPOSE` is a Dockerfile instruction used to indicate which port the containerized application will listen on at runtime. It serves as **documentation** and a **signal** to tools like Docker and Docker Compose, but it does **not** actually publish the port.

### Detailed explanation of the answer for readers’ understanding

The `EXPOSE` directive does **not open the port** to the outside world by itself. Instead, it tells Docker that the container is expected to listen on the specified port(s).

To make a port accessible to the host or external clients, you still need to use the `-p` or `--publish` flag when running the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 myapp
```

In this case:
- `80` → is the port inside the container (maybe defined using `EXPOSE`)
- `8080` → is the port exposed on the host machine

---

### 🔧 Example: Dockerfile with EXPOSE

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

The container is configured to listen on port `80`, but if you run it as:

```bash
docker run mynginx
```

It won’t be accessible externally unless you publish the port:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 mynginx
```

### 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “We used EXPOSE in all our base images so that developers and Docker Compose could understand the default ports our microservices used — even though we always mapped them explicitly with `ports:` in Compose.”

### Key takeaway

> "`EXPOSE` is a form of **documentation** inside the image to signal expected ports — it doesn't open ports on its own."
