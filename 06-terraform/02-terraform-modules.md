## What are modules in Terraform and why should we use them?

### Question  
What are modules in Terraform and why should we use them?

### Short explanation of the question  
Modules are the core unit of code organization in Terraform. This question tests your understanding of **reusability**, **abstraction**, and **clean code practices** in Infrastructure as Code.

### Answer  
Terraform modules are **self-contained packages of Terraform configuration** that can be reused across different projects or components.  
We use them to **avoid repetition**, **enforce consistency**, and **organize infrastructure** into logical components.

### Detailed explanation of the answer for readers’ understanding  

A **Terraform module** is just a folder with `.tf` files. The folder can be local, on GitHub, or even on the Terraform Registry.

There are two types of modules:
- **Root module**: the directory where `terraform apply` is run.
- **Child module**: a reusable set of configurations called from a root or another module.

#### 🔁 Why use modules?

| Benefit             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reusability**     | Define once, use anywhere (e.g., a VPC module used by multiple environments)|
| **Abstraction**     | Hide complex logic behind simple variables and outputs                      |
| **Consistency**     | Standardize infrastructure setup across teams                               |
| **Scalability**     | Easily manage large-scale infrastructure with modular breakdown             |
| **Maintainability** | Isolate changes to individual components without affecting the whole setup  |

#### 📦 Example: Creating an EC2 module

**Folder structure:**
```
modules/
  ec2-instance/
    main.tf
    variables.tf
    outputs.tf
```

**Calling the module from root:**

```hcl
module "my_ec2" {
  source        = "./modules/ec2-instance"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami_id        = "ami-0abcd1234"
}
```

### 🧠 Real-world Use Case

> “In our company, we had to provision EC2 instances with the same tags, monitoring setup, and IAM roles across multiple environments. Instead of duplicating this logic, we created a reusable `ec2-instance` module. This allowed dev teams to spin up compliant EC2s with just a few input variables.”

### Key takeaway

> "Terraform modules are like functions in programming — they promote clean, DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code and help build scalable, maintainable infrastructure."
